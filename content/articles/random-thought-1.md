My current design sucks. I need to improve that.
Yeah you need to,
**but first, release the first version.**

I want to refactor my codebase. there are so many things i could improve.
Good codebases equals to lesser bugs, refactoring is important,
**but first, release the first version.**

I want to set up my servers for scaling,
planning to scale is important,
**but first, release the first version.**

**Release that first version before your product is no longer needed. do it.**
