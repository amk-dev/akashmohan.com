title: 'Notes to myself after shipping my first product'
---

I shipped a test version of my product to a couple of my friends yesterday. so I have decided to reflect upon the whole idea of shipping my first product.

I've read countless articles and books on mistakes people make when shipping products. But when I shipped my first product I've made most of them.

I planned to ship yourgame in a week. but it took me almost three months to ship the first version. That's scary right. yeah. When I look back a lot of mistakes were made. Most of them could have been eliminated.

I wanted my codebase to look perfect, use all the modern tools, use the best coding conventions, have the perfect code organisation, should scale to the moon etc. The engineer in me was thriving, he was screaming out that I'm doing a good job. He was telling me that if some new dev has to be onboarded it's going to be easy, you are avoiding technical debt, you are reducing bugs in your code.

I knew all of this was true, provided my product is going to have a future.

I was planning for the future when I actually had no present.

The reality is all these things are not giving a direct benefit to my users.

At a certain point, I knew time was slipping on too fast, the founder in me finally took over and the project started moving fast, and I believe it is going to remain like that for the time to come.

I'm aiming to release 12 products in 2021. Yeah, it's a 12X challenge. I'm already behind. But I believe I can catch up.

( This article is a work in progress. I will be adding more to this )
