title: 'Everything Is Learnable'
---

There was this time when I decided to take guitar classes. The first thing I knew was how hard it was for me to bend my fingers. I thought I could never do this. It was hard, frustrating, time consuming and the results were nowhere visible. But eventually I was able to do it.

I went from A to B. Not being able to bend my fingers to being able to play nice verses. the results were drastic. I was seeing every inch of the journey. from my fingers being unable to bend, to doing it somehow, to getting sore, and finally being able to do it perfectly.

that incident has a real place in my heart. every time I struggle with something I think of it and I tell myself,

Everything is learnable.

I suck at art. So much so, that once when asked about a drawing on the back of my notebook, I had to lie to my classmates that my little sister who's 2 or 3 at that time drew it and they believed it. yes. I was that bad.

but then I wanted to make Internet products. I don't have the money to hire a designer to make designs for me. I had to do it myself. So I started, If it wasn't for that guitar incident I might not have went for it. first I made absolute trash of designs, then terrible designs, then bad designs and now I make designs that doesn't look ugly. May be after a couple of years I might be able to make nice designs. Who knows (winks),

Everything is learnable.

It wasn't just with me. I was seeing this phenomenon everywhere around me. People being so bad at something but because they had to do it and want it bad enough , getting better and better everyday.

Everything is learnable.
