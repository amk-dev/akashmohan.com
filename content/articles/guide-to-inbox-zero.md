title: 'The guide to inbox zero'
---

I created my first email account on 2/1/13. Its been 8 years, 3 months and 12 days as of writing this article. From my social accounts to some super spammy random websites that I don't remember signing up for. Every day a handful of emails hit my inbox no matter what. I don't read 99% of them. But they kept piling up day by day. so eventually I started missing the emails I wanted to read. My inbox became a place I hated to visit. But today I've decided to clean up everything, and make my inbox great again. Here are my tips after I've cleaned up more than 30000 emails.

1. 🚫 Unsubscribe from notification emails, except for Security Emails. ( Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Github, Linkedin, Youtube etc. ). You either use their app or web platform. You get notifications there.

2. 🏷 If you are using Gmail. use aliases to label emails. eg: you can use emails like johndoe+newsletters@gmail.com, johndoe+friends@gmail.com etc, they will still get delivered to johndoe@gmail.com. but you can filter and label them automatically.

3. 🗑 Delete all unread emails. No, you won't read them later. delete them. if you are super scared manually delete for the past month or so and delete everything else in a click. I've deleted almost 30,000 emails like this and nothing happened.

4. ❌ Delete or archive emails after you've read them. you can use Keyboard Shortcuts to speed things up.
   "u" for archiving
   "#" for deleting
   Keyboard Shortcuts are disabled by default on Gmail. You can enable them from settings.
